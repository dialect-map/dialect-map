# Dialect map ðŸ’¬

- PI: Kyle Cranmer
- Engineer: Sinclert PÃ©rez
- Data Scientist: Quynh M. Nguyen


## Project description
It is well known that terminology and jargon are one of the barriers to communication across disciplines.
The same mathematical concepts have different names (eg. _ELBO and free energy_).

Similarly, dialects vary geographically. Sometimes geographical maps that show how different words are used
for the same concept are very helpful. Dialect map proposes to make a similar map, where the geographic map 
is replaced with a 2-D visualization (embedding) of literature and then overlays how a certain concept
is named on this fixed 2-D representation of the domain literature.

This would be done with a hand created list of jargon terms, displayed in an interactive website.
