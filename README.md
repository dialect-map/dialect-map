# Data Science: Dialect map

- PI: Kyle Cranmer
- Student: Jiayi Du
- Advisor: Sinclert PÃ©rez


## Project description
It is well known that terminology and jargon are one of the barriers to communication across disciplines.
The same mathematical concepts have different names (eg. Gaussian Processes & Krigging; ELBO and free energy; etc.).

Similarly, dialects vary geographically.
Sometimes geographical maps that show how different words are used for the same concept are very helpful.
I propose to make a similar map, where the geographic map is replaced with a 2-d visualization (embedding) of literature
and then overlay how a certain concept is named on this fixed 2-d representation of the domain literature.

Initially this would be done with a hand created dictionary and displayed with an interactive website.
Stretch goals for the project would include using NLP to automate parts of this process.
