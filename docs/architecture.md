# Architecture

The idea of having an accurate and rich Dialect map to compare jargons side to side
is only possible thanks to the creation of an ecosystem of software components that 
allow us, developers, to have flexibility regarding their deployment, scalability
and access control.


## Project areas
The project components can be divided into 4 different areas:

- 📝 Public data (hosted at GitHub).
- 🚰 Ingestion jobs (hosted at NYU Greene).
- 🪨 Core database (hosted at GCP).
- 🗺️ Public web UI (hosted at GCP and PaperScape).
